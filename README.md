# requirements:
* Python 3.9+ (that's what I used but probably works with earlier 3's too)

# installation:
* pip install -r requirements.txt

# usage:
* `pytest --source=cached` to run tests off of `data.json` as a source (if one is present)
* `pytest --source=online` or just `pytest` to download new json before running test suite
